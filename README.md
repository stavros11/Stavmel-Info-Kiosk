# Stavmel-Info-Kiosk
A small application that contains tourist information about the island of Rhodes. 
It is used as the software for a touchscreen located in the reception of [our studios](https://www.stavmel.gr/en/) in Rhodes, Greece. 
Customers can use this to find information about how to move around in the island as well as interesting sights and beaches to visit.

Some pages (eg. the ones that contain beaches and sights) require an SQL database which is not published here. 
If there is interest in this, please open an issue. 
I created this database using `csv_to_sql.py` where the `csv` files were scrapped and editted "by hand".

The [tourist guide](https://www.rhodes.gr/tourist-guide/) created by the municipality of Rhodes was used as the main source for most of the information.
